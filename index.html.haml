    -# .content.en
    -#   %p In the field of pure technology, there is no evil and justice. We believe hacker represents an always challenging spirit with tremendous knowledge and skills.
    -#   %p Hacks in Taiwan (HITCON) is a highly technical security conference in Taiwan. We know there are a lot of information security researchers with very professional expertise and experience in Taiwan. Before Hacks in Taiwan, there’s no chance to gather them. So CHROOT had the idea to hold an annual conference for all people who are interested in security and hacking. We provide a stage for all hackers to share their newest and exciting findings, to talk without worries, to exchange experience face to face.
    -#   %p We are very careful in the quality of speeches. We hope presentations could be researches of latest trends or technologies, excellent hacking techniques, fresh and creative ideas, and with less commercial purpose.
    -#   %p In addition to knowledge sharing, we also hold the wargame event (a.k.a. Capture The Flag) for all attendees. Everyone can attend the game, solve puzzles, and have fun during whole conference. Besides, we have an IRC channel with a very large screen on the stage, wall of sheep, etc. Because of these interesting and unique peculiarities, we can attract a lot of people who are interested in security and hacking to attend the event.
    -#   %p HITCON is the hacker’s party. We invite everyone to come to Taiwan, join the party. You can experience Taiwan hacker’s culture, see most interesting and sensitive topics, and communicate with hackers as well as hacker groups.
